## About ðŸ‘‹

I am currently persuing B.Tech(IT) from Rajkiya Engineering College Azamgarh which is affiliated by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) formerly known as Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU). I am a python programmer. My hobbies are singing, playing chess and watching movies. I am greatly interested in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am enthusiastically looking forward to contribute to open source projects through Github.
